  @moduledoc """
  Implementation of the SRT server.

  ## API
  The client API consinsts of the following functions:

  * `start/2` - starts the server
  * `start/3` - starts the server with password authentication
  * `start_link/2` - starts the server and links to current process
  * `start_link/3` - starts the server with password authentication and links to current process
  * `stop/1` - stops the server
  * `accept_awaiting_connect_request/1` - accepts next incoming connection
  * `reject_awaiting_connect_request/1` - rejects next incoming connection
  * `close_server_connection/2` - stops server's connection to given client

  ## Password Authentication

  SRT supports password-based authentication. When using password authentication:
  - Password must be between 10 and 79 characters long (SRT specification requirement)
  - Empty string means no password authentication (default behavior)
  - All connecting clients must provide the same password

  A process starting the server will also receive the following notifications:
  * `t:srt_server_conn/0` - a new client connection has been established
  * `t:srt_server_conn_closed/0` - a client connection has been closed
  * `t:srt_server_error/0` - server has encountered an error
  * `t:srt_data/0` - server has received new data on a client connection
  * `t:srt_server_connect_request/0` - server has triggered a new connection request
    (see `accept_awaiting_connect_request/1` and `reject_awaiting_connect_request/1` for answering the request)

  ### Accepting connections
  Each SRT connection can carry a `streamid` string which can be used for identifying the stream.

  To support accepting/rejecting the connection a server sends `t:srt_server_connect_request/0` event.
  THe process that started the server is then obliged to either call  `accept_awaiting_connect_request/1` or `reject_awaiting_connect_request/1`.
  Not responding in time will result in server's rejecting the connection.

  When user rejects the stream, the server respons with `1403` rejection code (SRT wise). While not being to accept in time
  results in `1504` (not that the codes respectively are the same of HTTP 403 forbidden and 504 gateway timeout).

  > #### Response timeout {: .warning}
  >
  > It is very important to answer the connection request as fast as possible.
  > Due to how `libsrt` works, while the server waits for the response it blocks the receiving thread
  > and potentially interrupts other ongoing connections.
